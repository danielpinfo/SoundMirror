**original_problem_statement:**
The user's goal is to build **SoundMirror**, a native offline-first articulation visualization system for language learners. The core of the application is a clinical-grade animation engine that displays hyper-realistic mouth movements for phonemes, words, and sentences.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS (PRD):**
- **Mission:** Convert a web app concept into a fully native cross-platform mobile (React Native) and desktop (Tauri) application with minimal internet dependency.
- **Core Principles:**
    - The system is a phoneme-driven anatomical teaching tool.
    - Visuals are sprite sequences for front (lips/mouth) and side (tongue/jaw) views.
    - The animation engine must be movie quality, seamless, and mathematically precise. It must intelligently select frames from a large sprite library to create perfect articulation, not just play sequential frames.
    - **Animation Rules:**
        - Each phoneme animation should be short (~5 frames).
        - Each 10-frame phoneme cluster in the source assets has a sweet spot at frame #5, which the engine must prioritize.
        - The engine must seamlessly splice animations for different phonemes together without gaps.
        - Digraphs/trigraphs (like 'll', 'sh', 'ch') must be treated as single phonetic units.
        - Timing should be natural, like watching a person speak.
- **Asset Management:**
    - All visual assets (sprites) originate from the user's GitHub repository ().
    - All Letter Practice audio must use pre-recorded MP3 files for 10 languages, sourced from the user's S3 bucket.
    - Word Practice audio will use OS-native Text-to-Speech (TTS) engines.
- **Technical Strategy:**
    - **Pre-caching:** The engine must pre-load and cache all required animation frames during the page transition *before* the user clicks play to ensure smooth playback.
    - **Sprite Sheets:** Individual sprite frames must be combined into single-column sprite sheets to optimize loading and rendering.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A functional React web preview of the SoundMirror application exists in . This includes a splash screen and UI for all main pages.

The key recent accomplishment is a complete, ground-up rewrite of the animation engine inside  to meet the user's clinical-grade specifications. This new, untested engine is designed to:
- Use multi-part sprite sheets created from compressed JPEG source images.
- Intelligently select and sequence frames based on a sweet spot algorithm.
- Handle phonetic digraphs (e.g., treating 'll' as a single sound).
- Pre-cache image assets before animation begins.

Additionally, 240 pre-recorded phoneme audio files have been downloaded from the user's S3 bucket and are stored in . 500 source PNGs were compressed into JPEGs and then compiled into sprite sheets located in .

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The agent just finished a major, complex rewrite of the entire  component and its underlying logic in . This was to implement the user's final, precise specifications for a clinical-grade animation engine, including the sweet spot frame selection logic, digraph handling, and natural timing.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS (Code has been written but has not been tested).
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent. The primary goal is to verify that the newly written animation engine functions correctly and smoothly.
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1: (P0) Test and Verify the New Clinical-Grade Animation Engine.**
  - **Description:** The most recent and significant change was a complete overhaul of the animation logic. It is critical to test this thoroughly to ensure it meets the user's strict requirements for smoothness, timing, and accuracy. The user has previously been frustrated by jittery or non-working animations.
  - **Next debug checklist:**
      1. Check the frontend logs for any JavaScript errors introduced by the refactor: ==> /var/log/supervisor/frontend.err.log <==

      2. Navigate to the Letter Practice page () and confirm the layout is correct (heads always visible on the right).
      3. Click the Play Sound button and capture a screenshot mid-animation. Verify that the frame and sprite numbers (, ) are advancing and the mouth is visibly moving.
      4. Confirm that the animation plays **only once** and then stops, returning to the neutral frame (Sprite 0).
      5. Repeat the test on the Word Practice page (). Check that the animation timing feels natural (around 2-3 seconds, not 12) and that the phoneme badges correctly handle digraphs (e.g., 'll' in 'hello' should not be displayed as 'L', 'L').
  - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This will validate the core functionality of the application and address the user's primary concern about animation quality.
  - **Status:** NOT STARTED (Testing is pending)
  - **Is recurring issue?** Y (Animation performance and correctness has been the main recurring issue).
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
  - **Blocked on other issue:** None

**In progress Task List**:
None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
  - **P1: Implement Real Camera/Microphone Recording:** Replace the placeholder recording functionality with actual camera and microphone access.
  - **P1: Implement Animation Scrubbing:** Add a slider to allow the user to manually scrub back and forth through an animation sequence to see details.
- **Future Tasks:**
  - **P2: Implement ML-based Visual Scoring:** Integrate an ML library to analyze the user's lip/jaw movements and generate a Visual Score.
  - **P2: Build and Package Tauri Desktop App:** Port the verified web preview functionality to the Tauri app structure and create a distributable desktop application.
  - **P3: Develop React Native Mobile App:** Begin mobile app development.
  - **P3: Implement Offline Storage:** Use SQLite to save user progress and recordings locally.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Asset Integration & Processing:**
  - Successfully downloaded 500+ PNG sprites from the user's GitHub repository, resolving the initial blocker.
  - Connected to the user's S3 bucket and downloaded 240 pre-recorded phoneme audio MP3s.
  - Compressed all 500 high-resolution (600KB+) PNGs into lightweight (~15KB) JPEGs.
  - Generated multi-part, single-column sprite sheets from the compressed JPEGs to enable high-performance CSS sprite animation.
- **Animation Engine Evolution (Multiple Iterations):**
  - Replaced placeholder graphics with real sprites.
  - Iteratively debugged and fixed numerous animation bugs causing jitter, looping, and incorrect state.
  - Implemented the user's final clinical-grade specification for the animation engine, including sweet spot logic and digraph handling.
- **UI & Feature Implementation:**
  - Implemented all user-requested UI changes for the Splash, Word Practice, and Letter Practice pages.
  - Corrected the Letter Practice page layout to ensure the animated heads are always visible.
  - Replaced TTS on the Letter Practice page with the user's custom MP3 audio files.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- **Issue 1:** When testing the word hello, the phoneme badges on the Word Practice page displayed H, E, L, L, O. The new engine should handle ll as a single phoneme; this needs to be verified during the next testing phase.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- The agent initially struggled to access user-provided files, attempting a  instead of searching the local workspace. This pattern of not understanding pre-existing resources could recur.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, Vite
- **Animation:** High-performance CSS sprite animation () driven by .
- **Asset Pipeline:** Compression (Pillow) and sprite sheet generation.
- **Backend (for tooling):** Python, Boto3 (for S3 access).
- **Architecture:** Offline-first, asset-heavy, pre-caching logic.

**key DB schema**
- **(Planned):** Local SQLite database for  and .

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Your immediate task is to test the new animation engine.** The code in  was completely rewritten right before the handoff and is untested. The user's primary frustration has been with animation quality, so this must be perfect. Follow the debug checklist in the Pending Issues section.
- **The user is highly detail-oriented and specific.** Refer to their exact wording for the animation rules (sweet spot, seamless splicing, natural timing). Do not deviate.
- ** is a time bomb.** Be aware that the entire application lives in this one file. While your immediate priority is testing, the next logical step after stabilization should be proposing a refactor to break this file apart.
- **Do not try to re-process images.** The sprite sheets have been created. Your focus should be on the rendering logic that uses them.

3. **Agent:** Acknowledges the new spec and begins implementation.
4. **Agent:** Hits a 65,500 pixel limit for JPEG sprite sheets.
5. **Agent:** Decides to use PNG or split sheets. Creates 5 sprite sheet sections per view instead of one giant one.
6. **Agent:** States it will create the new intelligent sprite engine.
7. **Agent:** Views the current  code.
8. **Agent:** Proposes to replace the entire animator with the new implementation.
9. **Agent:** Executes the  to update  with the new engine.
10. **Agent:** Identifies and removes duplicate/old code left over from the replacement. (This is where the session ended).

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken:**
  - The core animation engine is in an untested state after a complete rewrite. It is effectively broken until proven otherwise.
- **Mocked:**
  - The entire web preview in  is a mock of the final Tauri/React Native application.
  - Camera/microphone recording functionality is a placeholder.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- **boto3:** Used to connect to the user's AWS S3 bucket to download audio assets. Credentials were provided and used.
- **Planned:** OS-native TTS APIs for various platforms.

**Testing status**
- **Testing agent used after significant changes:** NO (Not since the final animation engine rewrite).
- **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
- **Test files created:** None.
- **Known regressions:** None recently, but the entire animation system is in an unknown state.

**Credentials to test flow:**
N/A

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent has not yet tested the final, clinical-grade animation engine it just finished writing.
- An earlier observation noted that the phoneme badges for hello showed L, L instead of a single phoneme for ll. This needs to be re-verified with the new digraph-aware engine.
